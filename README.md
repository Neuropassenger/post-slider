### How to change the slider height?

The slider height can be customized through CSS. By default, the slider has a height of 100vh (100% of the viewport height).

### Can I disable automatic slide scrolling?

In the current version, automatic scrolling cannot be disabled through the interface. To do this, you need to edit the `assets/js/post-slider.js` file.

When random posts mode is enabled, the slider will display random posts from your entire site, ignoring the sorting and category settings. This is useful for showcasing diverse content from your blog.
